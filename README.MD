JJ.Demos.FluentNotation
=======================

*Jan-Joost van Zon, 2013*

Introduction
------------

This is a Visual Studio 2010 C# project.

This demo project considers some alternatives for syntaxes, that lead to my choosing a fluent syntax. It demonstrate how you can implement a fluent notation.

See the ItemValidator class. Excuse my sarcasm in the comment in the code.
